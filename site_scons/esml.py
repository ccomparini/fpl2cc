  esml - Even Simpler Minimal Language

  The idea behind this is to make it as simple as possible to write
  and compare data dumps.  For example, if you have 1000 elements and
  only the 534th ones differ, a simple command line diff will show
  exactly those elements.  Same with nested structures - if there are
  deeply nested structures, even very deep differences are easy to find
  and examine using standard unix command line tools.

  None of json, yaml, nor toml could give me anything satisfactory in
  this regard.

  Key features:
   - trailing commas are allowed
   - multiline strings are allowed (in fact, required if there's a newline)
   - mixed type arrays work
   - everything is flattened:
     - each element of each dict gets its own line with the
       full path to the element.  eg:
           { 'foo': 'bar', 'bat': { 'a': 1, 'wup': 23, 'moo': 'hi' } }
       becomes:
           bat.a = 1
           bat.moo = 'hi'
           bat.wup = 23
           foo = bar
       (note the sorting and that each assignment gets its own line)
     - each array item gets its own line, including the array subscript
       (in square brackets)
     - None/missing values are valid (and represented by nothing).
       example:
           { 'foo': None }
       becomes:
           foo = 

   Disadvantages:
     - output is bulkier than json, toml, and pretty much anything else
     - I made this up so there's no off-the-shelf parser for python.
       However, it's very easy to parse - everything is
           <nested key> = [value]
       .. and, of course (per the goal) just about any unix command line
       tool will "parse" it for the principle purposes.

#
# New NEW plan is to blow off both json and toml, because
# neither of them is suitable for what I want.
#
# Why this?
#   - stderr, stdout, return codes, and anything else can all go
#     in one output file per test; hence less clutter.
#   - Unlike json (which I tried first), toml will let me do multiline
#     strings, which is much easier to read and diff.
#   - Unlike toml (which I tried next), common line-based tools
#     (diff, grep, etc) will work relatively well for analysing
#     the output.
#   - As with toml, I'd have to write a dumper anyway, so for this
#     context it's not any significant reinvention.
