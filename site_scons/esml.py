# New NEW plan is to blow off both json and toml, because
# neither of them is suitable for what I want.
#
# Why?
#   - stderr, stdout, return codes, and anything else can all go
#     in one output file per test; hence less clutter.
#   - Unlike json (which I tried first), toml will let me do multiline
#     strings, which is much easier to read and diff.
#   - Unlike toml (which I tried next), common line-based tools
#     (diff, grep, etc) will work relatively well for analysing
#     the output.
#   - As with toml, I'd have to write a dumper anyway, so for this
#     context it's not any significant reinvention.

  esml - Even Simpler Minimal Language

  None of json, yaml, nor toml gave me what I want.  Hence this.

  Overview of key features:
   - trailing commas are allowed
   - multiline strings are allowed (in fact, required if there's a newline)
   - mixed type arrays work
   - everything is flattened:
     - each element of each dict gets its own line with the
       full path to the element.  eg:
           { 'foo': 'bar', 'bat': { 'a': 1, 'wup': 23, 'moo': 'hi' } }
       becomes:
           bat.a = 1
           bat.moo = 'hi'
           bat.wup = 23
           foo = bar
       (note the sorting and that each assignment gets its own line)
     - each array item gets its own line, including the array subscript
       (in square brackets)
     - None/missing values are valid (and represented by nothing).
       example:
           { 'foo': None }
       becomes:
           foo = 

   The idea behind all this is to make it as simple as possible to
   write and compare data dumps.  For example, if you have 1000 elements
   and only the 534th ones differ, a simple command line diff will show
   exactly which element differ.  Same with nested structures - if
   there are deeply nested structures, even very deep differences
   are easy to find and examine using standard unix command line tools.

   Disadvantages:
       - output is bulkier than json, toml, and pretty much anything else
       - I made this up so there's no off-the-shelf parser*.
         however, I expect it would be easy to parse - everything
         is <nested key> = [value].

   *per the goal, just about every command line unix tool is a "parser"
   for most of the key purposes.
