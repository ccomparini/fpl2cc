The sub str is \"hello world\" and maybe we'll do it 23 times.

For the 0th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 1th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 2th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 3th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 4th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 5th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 6th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 7th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 8th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 9th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 10th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 11th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 12th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 13th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 14th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 15th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 16th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 17th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 18th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 19th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 20th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 21th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".
For the 22th time, we're substituting in this string: \"hello world\".

I hope we did it 23 times.  23 + 2 = 25.

does if/else work?
I think yes, because this is else.

some even numbers, for your enjoyment:
