# This started with:
#  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_ascent_parser
# .. actually we've now blown off recursive ascent in favor
# of a state-function lalr approach, mainly because getting
# the generated products to the generated code was too
# weird in recursive ascent.  or, at least I couldn't figure
# out a reasonable way to do it.  maybe there is a way.
# moving on.
#
# Bison:
#
#   expr : expr '+' term   { $$ = $1 + $3; }
#        | expr '-' term   { $$ = $1 - $3; }
#        | term            { $$ = $1; }
#        ;
#
#   term : '(' expr ')'    { $$ = $2; }
#        | num             { $$ = $1; }
#        ;
#
#   num : '0'              { $$ = 0; }
#       | '1'              { $$ = 1; }
#       ;
#
# .. except the above was too simple for me to care
# so I added unary minus, proper numbers, comments,
# etc.  This has become a sort of general fpl test
# bed based on the classic desk calculator case.
