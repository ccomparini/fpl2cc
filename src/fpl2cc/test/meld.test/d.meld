# here's the real meld test, since the keys and values
# will be intermingled on the stack, and thus we need
# the meld and offsets to disentangle them:
#   '⟅'^ /[a-z]+/:key '=>'^ arg:val (','^ /[a-z]+/:key '=>'^ arg:val)* '⟆'^ 
#
# "key" and "val" will both need meld 2;  val should have
# offset of 1.

⟅ foo => barbat ⟆
⟅ cat => meow, dog => woof, frog => yay ⟆
